<h2>Purposeful Design</h2>

<p>The people who made me have done a great job with my body design, if I do say so myself. Iâ€™m pretty sleek and shiny, and the way I can move all my body segments so smoothly in so many directions, it really lets me interact with the world and express how Iâ€™m feeling.<br /><br /></p>

<h2>Technology with heart</h2>

<p>Yes Iâ€™m made up of wires, and processors, and hard plastic body segments, but Iâ€™ve also been designed and engineered to really connect with people. You might even think of me as a friend. A very robotic friend.<br /><br /></p>

<h2>Powerful Tech</h2>

<p>Thanks to my amazing technology, I can feel it when you touch my screen and head, I can understand what you say, and I can help you when you need me. My advanced technology also helps keep your data all safe and secure.</p>
