As an Engineer, I tried to analyze the world in a logical and systematical way based on the engineering knowledge that I have learned.
However, there were many values that cannot be judged to be the only truth, I realized that I could not interpret them solely by Engineering knowledge.
Accordingly, I became interested not only in Engineering but also in convergence studies where various studies gets combined.  <br />
My lifetime goal is to make advances in technology by intermingling the various kinds of studies and always strive to create something from that gained knowledge to make a better future.   <br />
