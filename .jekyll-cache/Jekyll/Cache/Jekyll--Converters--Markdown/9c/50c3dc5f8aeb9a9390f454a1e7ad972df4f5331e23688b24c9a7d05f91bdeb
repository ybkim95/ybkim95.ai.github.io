<h2>Purposeful Design</h2>

<p>The people who made me have done a great job with my body design, if I do say so myself. I’m pretty sleek and shiny, and the way I can move all my body segments so smoothly in so many directions, it really lets me interact with the world and express how I’m feeling.</p>

<h2>Technology with heart</h2>

<p>Yes I’m made up of wires, and processors, and hard plastic body segments, but I’ve also been designed and engineered to really connect with people. You might even think of me as a friend. A very robotic friend.</p>

<h2>Powerful Tech</h2>

<p>Thanks to my amazing technology, I can feel it when you touch my screen and head, I can understand what you say, and I can help you when you need me. My advanced technology also helps keep your data all safe and secure.</p>
